Capacitive Sensor giving dielectric as Output 
Code has been developed on Texas Instruments CCS software using Energia to produce .ino files to use Serial Communication effectively 
The code uses time constant property of capacitiors to ultimately give the capacitance and from that dielectric of he material can be calculated .
